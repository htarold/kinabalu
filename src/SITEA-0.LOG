# This is an example config/log file for the audio recorder, to
# be placed in the top level directory ("folder") of the SD card.
# This file must be named according to this format:
#<sitename>-0.LOG
# where <sitename> is up to 5 characters.  The "-0" part is
# required for a feature yet to be written.  The ".LOG" part is
# obligatory, and all characters MUST be ASCII upper case.
#
# You should also note the deployer's name, microphone array
# type and orientation, and any other relevant info to this file.
#
# In addition, whenever the recorder starts up, it will automatically
# record for 20 seconds, before proceeding to record according
# to the specified schedule.  This is to allow the deployer to
# make a voice recording detailing last minute details of the
# installation.
#
# The first part of this file consists of configuration
# directives.  3 directives are recognised:
#
# sync 2019 jun 20 14:23:30 thu
# says to set the real time clock to this date/time, when the recorder
# is run.  Note capitalisation.  This directive is optional, but
# the recorder will fail if the RTC is not already initialised.
# 
#record sun-sat 0-23:0-59/2 90
#
# This says to record every day (Sunday to Saturday), every hour
# (0-23) and every OTHER minute (0-59/2) for 90 seconds.
# 
# record jan-mar,jul 1-11/2,31 0-23/4:0 120
# Multiple record directive may appear.  The first matching one is
# used.  The form above specifies the day by calendar date rather
# than day of week.  The recorder will record every January,
# February, March, and July, the first to 11th days (inclusive),
# and the 31st (not February, which doesn't have a 31st), at the
# top of every 4th hour (midnight, 4am, 8am, noon, 4pm, 8pm) for 2
# minutes.
# 
# Just before and after a recording, sensor data are
# read and the results are logged (in this file).  This occurs even if
# the recording duration is 0 (when no audio recording is performed).
# 
#end
# The last directive must be end.  The recorder will append
# diagnostics etc. to the file after the end directive.
#
# Following is a configuration suitable for testing:
#ync 2019 may 20 15:25 mon
record sun-sat 0-23:0-59/2 90
