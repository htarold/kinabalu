# This is an example config/log file for the audio recorder, to
# be placed in the top level directory ("folder") of the SD
# card, which must be FAT32 formatted.
# This file must be named according to this format:
#<sitename>-0.LOG
# where <sitename> is up to 5 characters.  The "-0" part is
# required for a feature yet to be written.  The ".LOG" part is
# obligatory, and all characters MUST be ASCII upper case.
#
# You should also note the deployer's name, microphone array
# type and orientation, and any other relevant info to this file.
#
# This file also serves as the operations guide, since it will
# always be accessible when the recorder is to be used.
#
# Whenever the recorder starts up, it will automatically
# record for 20 seconds, before proceeding to record according
# to the specified schedule.  This is to allow the deployer to
# make a voice recording detailing last minute details of the
# installation.
#
# The first part of this file consists of configuration
# directives.  3 directives are recognised, the first is sync:
#
#sync 2019 jun 20 14:23:30 thu
#
# The above sync directive says to set the real time clock to this
# date/time, when the recorder is turned on.  Note the capitalisation.
# This directive is optional, but time on the real time clock (RTC)
# of the recorder must be initialised or the recorder will not run.
#
# It should be obvious now that every line starting with a "#"
# mark is a comment, and will not be interpreted as a directive.
# After a sync directive is executed, the "s" of "sync" will be
# replaced by a "#", so the directive will be executed only
# once.
#
# The attention LED (yellow) on the recorder board will turn on
# whenever the firmware enters a critical section of code, and
# will turn off when it clears that critical section, usually
# within a couple of seconds.  If it remains on indefinitely,
# something is wrong.  See later in this file for
# troubleshooting.  When deploying, it is enough to verify
# that the yellow attention LED goes off to confirm the recorder
# is operating properly.
# 
#record sun-sat 0-23:0-59/2 90
#
# record directives are the way to schedule recordings, and
# there may be up to 6 of them.  The above record directive
# says to record every day (Sunday to Saturday), every hour
# (0-23) and every OTHER minute (0-59/2) for 90 seconds.
# 
#record jan-mar,jul 1-11/2,31 0-23/4:0 120
#
# A record directive can be more complicated.  Instead of
# specifying the day of week, you can specify the month and day
# of month.  In the above, the month is specified as a range
# "jan-mar" and singly "jul", and these two are combined as a
# list using "," (the comma).
#
# As multiple record directive may appear, the first one that matches
# the current day and time is used.  Given the directive above,
# the recorder will record every January, February, March, and July,
# the first to 11th days (inclusive), and the 31st of those months
# (but not February, which doesn't have a 31st), at the top of every
# 4th hour starting from midnight (i.e. midnight, 4am, 8am, noon,
# 4pm, 8pm only) of those days, for 2 minutes.
# 
# Just before and after a recording, sensor data are
# read and the results are logged (to this file).  This occurs even if
# the recording duration is 0 (when no audio recording is performed).
# 
#end
# The last directive must be end.  The recorder will append
# diagnostics and sensor data to the file after the end
# directive, which you can review after retrieving the recorder
# to verify its proper operation.
#
# Troubleshooting:
# Apart from the yellow attention LED, the green LED indicates
# SD card access, and the red one indicates diagnostics output.
# When sleeping between recordings, none of the LEDs will be on
# (but the green LED may glow faintly; this is unimportant).
# When recording, the green LED will be decidedly on, and the
# red LED will flicker occasionally to indicate diagnostic
# output is available.  Yellow may flicker occasionally.  This
# is the normal behaviour of the recorder.
#
# In the field it may not be possible to do detailed
# troubleshooting; then if the yellow LED remains on, it is
# sufficient to take note of the other LEDs and retrieve the
# recorder to troubleshoot later.
#
# After verifying the recorder is set up correctly, connect the
# USB-to-serial adaptor between the laptop and the recorder, set
# the serial parameters to 57600 bps, 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity
# (i.e. 8n1) in your terminal emulator (such as putty).  Reboot or
# power on the recorder and watch the diagnostics on your screen.
# The diagnostics will indicate the problem, such as uninitialised
# RTC time or missing SD card, which you should then rectify.
#
# You should always test a configuration file before deploying
# the unit.  The first test is for syntax errors.  Simply boot
# up with the configuration file while watching the diagnostics.
# If there is a syntax error (like a misspelled directive), the
# diagnostics will indicate this.  If it passes this test, wait
# for the diagnostics to print a schedule table, which indicates
# when it will wake up to record.  You should check this table
# to verify the unit's understanding of your intent.
#
# Tips on Deployment:
# The recorder should be deployed with the microphones (which
# are omnidirectional) pointing downwards, to prevent rain
# entry.  Care should be taken that the recorder enclosure
# and its contents do not rattle.  The recorder should not be
# deployed where it will be in direct sun, as this will affect
# the temperature readings.  It is best to avoid powering off
# the recorder when the SD card is in use (green LED is on), as
# this can cause the card to be corrupted.  You should run
# chkdsk or similar to be sure.
#
# Following is a configuration suitable for testing:
#ync 2019 may 20 15:25 mon
record sun-sat 0-23:0-59/2 90
